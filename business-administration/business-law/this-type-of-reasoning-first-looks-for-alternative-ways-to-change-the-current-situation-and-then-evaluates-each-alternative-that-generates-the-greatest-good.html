<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Consequence-based reasoning first looks for alternative ways to alter the current situation. Then it attempts to forecast the consequences that will arise from each alternative. Finally, it evaluates those possible consequences to select the alternative that generate the greatest good.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-1) Consequences-Based Ethical Reasoning-In this style of ethical reasoning, rightness or wrongness is based only on the results of the action. Particular acts have no ethical, or moral, character. An act that produces good consequences is good. An act that produces bad consequences is bad.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Why do the two forms of ethical reasoning, consequences-based and rule-based, usually result in the same decision, and what is the probable cause when they do not?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-All teleological ethical theories locate moral goodness in the consequences of our actions. According to teleological (or consequentialist) moral theory, all rational human actions are teleological in the sense that we reason about the means of achieving certain ends. Moral behavior, therefore, is goal goal-directed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Ethical reasoning helps determine and differentiate between right thinking, decisions, and actions and those that are wrong, hurtful and/or harmful-to others and to ourselves. Ethics is based on and motivated by facts, values, emotions, beliefs, emotions, and feelings.
