<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The side that files the appeal is called the “appellant.” The other side is called the “respondent.” If you appeal, the appellate court will review the trial court record to decide if a legal mistake was made in the trial court that changed the outcome of the case.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An appeal is when someone who loses a case in a trial court asks a higher court (the appellate court) to review the trial court’s decision. In almost all cases, the appellate court ONLY looks at two things: Whether a LEGAL mistake was made in the trial court; AND.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What is a Review Petition? The review petition is a petition in which it is prayed before the Court of law to review its order or judgement which it has already pronounced. The Court may accept a review petition when a glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In revision, the High Court can of its own accord, send for the case but for review an application has to be made by the aggrieved party. No appeal lies from an order made in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction, but the order granting review is appealable.
