<meta name="description" content="Answer: An agreement consists of reciprocal promises between at least two parties. Explanation: An agreement is also called a contract.When a contract consists of reciprocal promises to be simultaneously performed, no promisor need perform his promise unless the promisee is ready and willing to perform his reciprocal promise. (a) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B to be paid for by B on delivery.A bilateral contract, however, contains firm agreements and promises between two parties.In this article, we have defined what a reciprocal promise is. We have also discussed the various types of reciprocal promises (mutual and independent, conditional and concurrent).Example: When you go to a shop, the shopkeeper agrees to give you the product in exchange for money. This is an example of a reciprocal promise where you promise to pay the value of the product and the shopkeeper promises to give you the goods on receipt of the payment.">
