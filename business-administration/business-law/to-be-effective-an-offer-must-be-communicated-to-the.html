<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An offer is effective as soon as it is dispatched. An offer must be communicated to the offeree in order for the offer to be effective. An advertisement is usually an offer to sell. A valid offer may be in the form of an act for a promise, which is an offer to enter into an inverted unilateral contract.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror through written or oral means as silence will not be considered a valid form of approval. The communication of acceptance of an offer should be absolute. The offer will be considered accepted, once the promisee dispatches their acceptance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An offer is not effective until it is received by the offeree (and thatâ€™s also true of a revocation of the offer, and a rejection of the offer by the offeree). The requirement that an offer be communicated does not mean that every term must be communicated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Offer must be communicated :-The offeror must communicate offer to the offeree. The communication can be either in oral or written form. The offer can directly communicate to the person specific to whom it is offered or it can be in general in nature.
