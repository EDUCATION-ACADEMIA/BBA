<title>A void contract
</title>
<meta name="description" content="A void contract is a contract that isnt legally enforceable, starting from the time it was created. While both a void and voidable contract are null, a void contract cannot be ratified. In a legal sense, a void contract is treated as if it was never created and becomes unenforceable in court.What is the Effect of a Void Contract? A void contract means neither party can enforce the contract when it was formed, as the contract had never been created. Therefore, neither party can enforce any rights or perform any obligations set out in the contract. A void contract is different from a voidable contract.A void contract is a formal agreement that is illegitimate and unenforceable from the moment it is created.A void agreement is one, which according to law is neither enforceable nor it creates any legal consequences. The void contract, on the other hand, is a contract which is valid at the time of formation but becomes unenforceable, due to impossibility or illegality. A void agreement is void since it has been created.On the other hand, the void agreements are not enforceable by the law and there is no legal recourse. However, performance of the agreement can be done as it is not strictly forbidden. Hence, this means that all illegal agreements are void in nature but it is not necessary that all void agreements are illegal.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A void contract is a contract that isnâ€™t legally enforceable, starting from the time it was created. While both a void and voidable contract are null, a void contract cannot be ratified. In a legal sense, a void contract is treated as if it was never created and becomes unenforceable in court.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What is the Effect of a Void Contract? A void contract means neither party can enforce the contract when it was formed, as the contract had never been created. Therefore, neither party can enforce any rights or perform any obligations set out in the contract. A void contract is different from a voidable contract.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A void contract is a formal agreement that is illegitimate and unenforceable from the moment it is created.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A void agreement is one, which according to law is neither enforceable nor it creates any legal consequences. The void contract, on the other hand, is a contract which is valid at the time of formation but becomes unenforceable, due to impossibility or illegality. A void agreement is void since it has been created.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-On the other hand, the void agreements are not enforceable by the law and there is no legal recourse. However, performance of the agreement can be done as it is not strictly forbidden. Hence, this means that all illegal agreements are void in nature but it is not necessary that all void agreements are illegal.
