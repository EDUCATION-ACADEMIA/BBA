<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Options-If the offeree gives the offeror something of value in return for a promise to keep the offer open, this agreement is itself a binding contract. It is called an option. Firm Offers – A special rule applies to merchants (those who regularly deal in the goods bought or sold).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A proposal by an offeror to do something, provided the offeree does something in return. In making a counteroffer, the offeree says in legal effect, “I refuse your offer; here is my proposal.” The counteroffer terminates the original offer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-(1) A counteroffer is an offer made by an offeree to his offeror relating to the same matter as the original offer and proposing a substituted bargain differing from that proposed by the original offer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A conditional or qualified acceptance is an acceptance that adds to, or changes, the terms of the original offer. This is essentially a counteroffer. A conditional or qualified acceptance generally terminates the offeree’s power of acceptance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-REVOCATION. Revocation means an offer is withdrawn by the offerer. The general rule was established in Payne v Cave [1] that an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance takes place. However, the revocation must be communicated effectively directly or indirectly to the offeree before acceptance [2] .
