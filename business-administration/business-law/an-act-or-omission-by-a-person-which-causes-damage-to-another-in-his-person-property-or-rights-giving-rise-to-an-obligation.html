<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this chapter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Quasi delicts are acts that cause damage or harm to another person or to his goods outwith the four civil delicts. Since from these acts a duty arises to compensate the damage or the harm caused to the victim, the quasi delicts were considered one of the four sources of obligation in the Justinian Institutes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When the wrongful act or omission is accompanied by inten-tion it is a delict. When the wrongful act or omission is accompanied by negligence it is a quasi-delict.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-While delict occurs due to someoneâ€™s intentional actions, quasi delict is the result of unintentional negligence. For example, someone who accidentally injures another person is still responsible for their actions, but this is considered a quasi delict breach of obligation, rather than a delict breach.
