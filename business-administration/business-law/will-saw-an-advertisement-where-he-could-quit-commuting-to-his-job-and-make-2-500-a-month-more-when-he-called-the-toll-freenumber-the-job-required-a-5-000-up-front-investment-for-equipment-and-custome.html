<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An output contract is too vague to be a legally-enforceable agreement. An offer is effective only if it is communicated by the offeror in person. An offer gives the offeror the power to bind the offeree by contract. A revocation of an offer is ordinarily effective only when it is communicated to the offeree.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An offer can be accepted by the offeree or any third party. Acceptance may consist of words or conduct. Acceptance of an e-contract must show that an offeree voluntarily assented to the offer’s terms. A click-on agreement can indicate the acceptance of an online offer.
