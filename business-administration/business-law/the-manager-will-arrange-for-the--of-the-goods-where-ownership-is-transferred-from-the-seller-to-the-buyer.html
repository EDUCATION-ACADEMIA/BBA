</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Once the goods are delivered to the buyer’s specified location, the title of ownership of the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer. Consequently, the seller legally owns the goods and is responsible for the goods during the shipping process.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price. There may be a contract of sale between one part-owner and another. (2) A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-’Property in Goods’ which means the ownership of goods, is different from ‘ possession of goods’ which means the physical custody or control of the goods. The transfer of property in the goods from the seller to the buyer is the essence of a contract of sale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Explanation: Selling comprises all those personal and impersonal activities involved in finding, securing and developing a demand for a given product or service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
