<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It’s expected that both (or all) parties to a contract have the ability to understand exactly what it is they are agreeing to. If it appears that one side did not have this reasoning capacity, the contract may be held unenforceable against that person.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In brief, the answer is “yes” assuming that you had the opportunity to review the contract and seek out a translation or a translator. Generally speaking, parties are not required to translate a contract into another language for the other party.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Once a trial judge determines that a contract contains an ambiguity – meaning the contract or a provision within the contract is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations – the court will look beyond the language of the contract itself to resolve the ambiguity and enforce the contract.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A written contract is a printed agreement between two parties, one a lender and one a borrower. Written contracts are not only legally binding documents, but also more enforceable than an oral agreement.
