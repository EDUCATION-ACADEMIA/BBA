<strong>Concept note-1:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-One of the main characteristics of unconscionable contracts is that one of the parties signed the contract in a situation that involved pressure, lack of information, or because they were misled. If a lawsuit is filed and the court finds that a contract is unconscionable, the contract will typically be declared void.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If a contract is unfair or oppressive to one party in a way that suggests abuses during its formation, a court may find it unconscionable and refuse to enforce it. A contract is most likely to be found unconscionable if both unfair bargaining and unfair substantive terms are shown.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-“Unconscionability is a common law doctrine that courts have used to prevent the enforcement of contractual provisions that are overreaches by one party to gain ‘an unjust and undeserved advantage which it would be inequitable to permit him to enforce.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Unconscionability, in relation to contracts, has generally been recognized to include absence of a meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties to avoid the contractual terms which unreasonably favour one party against the other party.
