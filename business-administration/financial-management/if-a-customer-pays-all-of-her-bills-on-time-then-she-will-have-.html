<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Bottom Line: Building a strong payment history, which can help in telling your creditors that you pay your bills on time, is likely to boost your credit. Late payments can hurt your payment history by pushing your credit scores down and making you look like a higher-risk borrower.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Credit scores can be improved in many ways, but paying utility bills on time is usually not enough to make a meaningful difference. While gas, electric, and water are common utility bills that people pay, the information is not reported to the credit agencies and does not appear on an individual’s credit report.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Paying noncredit bills like rent, utilities, and medical expenses on time won’t bump up your credit score because they’re usually not reported to credit bureaus. But if they’re very late or in collections, they’ll likely get reported and affect credit scores negatively.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-One of the best things you can do to improve your credit score is to pay your debts on time and in full whenever possible. Payment history makes up a significant chunk of your credit score, so it’s important to avoid late payments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-On-time payments are the biggest factor affecting your credit score, so missing a payment can sting. If you have otherwise spotless credit, a payment that’s more than 30 days past due can knock as many as 100 points off your credit score. If your score is already low, it won’t hurt it as much but will still do damage.
