Payback Period = 1, 00, 000/20, 000 = 5 years.Payback period can be defined as period of time required to recover its initial cost and expenses and cost of investment done for project to reach at time where there is no loss no profit i.e. breakeven point.2.3.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The term payback period refers to the amount of time it takes to recover the cost of an investment. Simply put, it is the length of time an investment reaches a breakeven point.
