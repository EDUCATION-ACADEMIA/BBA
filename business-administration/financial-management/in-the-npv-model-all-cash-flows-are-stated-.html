<p>(A) in future value dollars, and the total inflow is “netted” against the outflow to see if the net amount is positive or negative 
</p>
<p>(B) ** in present value or current dollars, and the total inflow is “netted” against the initial outflow to see if the net amount is positive or negative 
</p>
<p>(C) in present value or current dollars, and the outflow is “netted” against the total inflow to see if the gross amount is positive or negative

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in capital budgeting and investment planning to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-NPV will always decrease. For a given stream of expected cash flows, the net present value (NPV) of a project is inversely related to the discount rate. Hence, an increase in the discount rate from 8% to 10% will always lead to a decrease in the net present value (NPV).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Net Present Value (NPV) is a method that is primarily used for financial analysis in determining the feasibility of investment in a project or a business. It is the present value of future cash flows compared with the initial investments.
