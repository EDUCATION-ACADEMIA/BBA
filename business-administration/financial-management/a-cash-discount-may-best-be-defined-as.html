For example, if the price of the product is $200 and the discount rate is 10%, then the cash discount would equal $20, which means the consumer saves $20.This means that 2% can be deducted by the customer if they make payment within 10 days; otherwise, the full amount is due in 30 days. Under the reward interpretation, the discount taken by the customer is treated as a cost of obtaining the cash earlier.">

<strong>Concept note-4:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
