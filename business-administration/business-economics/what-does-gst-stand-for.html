<meta name="description" content="GST stands for Goods and Services Tax which is levied on the supply of goods or services or both in India.GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition, which makes GST essentially a tax only on value addition at each stage.The constitution defines goods and services tax as any tax on supply of goods, or services or both except taxes on the supply of the alcoholic liquor for human consumption. The Central and State governments have simultaneous powers to levy GST on Intra-state supply.The goods and services tax (GST) is a tax on goods and services sold domestically for consumption. The tax is included in the final price and paid by consumers at point of sale and passed to the government by the seller. The GST is usually taxed as a single rate across a nation.Goods and services are divided into five different tax slabs for collection of tax: 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. However, petroleum products, alcoholic drinks, and electricity are not taxed under GST and instead are taxed separately by the individual state governments, as per the previous tax system.">
