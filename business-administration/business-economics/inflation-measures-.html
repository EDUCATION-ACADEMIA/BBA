<meta name="description" content="Inflation is the rate of increase in prices over a given period of time. Inflation is typically a broad measure, such as the overall increase in prices or the increase in the cost of living in a country.Inflation is an increase in the level of prices of the goods and services that households buy. It is measured as the rate of change of those prices. Typically, prices rise over time, but prices can also fall (a situation called deflation).Inflation is an economic situation where the general price level in the economy for all the relevant goods has a constant appreciable rise over a considerable period of time. in other words, it refers to a persistent upward movement in the general price level of all relevant goods and services in the economy.Inflation is sometimes classified into three types: demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. The most commonly used inflation indexes are the Consumer Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index.The increase in the general level of prices may be caused by many factors like an increase in the money supply, a decrease in the aggregate level of output, an increase in the effective demand, an increase in income, the rapid growth of population, etc.">
