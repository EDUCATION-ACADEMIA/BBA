</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Knowledge of interdependence: The circular flow model underpins the knowledge of interdependence between sectors in an economic system. The activities and money flows cannot take place without interaction with another sector.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The circular flow model highlights the “flows” within the economy-the flow of economic resources, goods and services, and the flow of money.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:

This money allows firms to continue to produce these goods and services and to also increase its output and ability to make a profit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The size of an economy is typically measured by the total production of goods and services in the economy, which is called gross domestic product (GDP). The different sectors within the economy are linked together. This interdependence means that a change in one sector can affect the rest.
