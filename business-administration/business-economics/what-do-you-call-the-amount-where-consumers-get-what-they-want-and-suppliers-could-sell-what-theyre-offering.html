<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The resulting price is referred to as the equilibrium price and represents an agreement between producers and consumers of the good. In equilibrium the quantity of a good supplied by producers equals the quantity demanded by consumers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree-that is, where the amount consumers want to buy of the product, quantity demanded, is equal to the amount producers want to sell, quantity supplied. This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The higher the price, the more suppliers are likely to produce. Conversely, buyers tend to purchase more of a product the lower its price. The equation that spells out the quantities consumers are willing to buy at each price is called the demand curve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Economists define supply as the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at each possible price during a given time period.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Demand is simply the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price in a given time period.
