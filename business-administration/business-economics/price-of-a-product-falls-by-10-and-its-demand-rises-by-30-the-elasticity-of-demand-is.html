<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Solution(By Examveda Team) The elasticity of demand is 3.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Therefore, the ratio of 6/5 gives us 1.2, which indicates that the demand for the commodity is elastic.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-So, if the price of a good increases by 10 percent and the quantity demanded decreases by only 5 percent, that good is said to have inelastic demand.
