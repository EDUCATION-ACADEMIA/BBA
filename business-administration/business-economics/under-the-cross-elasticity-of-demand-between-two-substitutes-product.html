<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Consequently, as the price of a product decreases, the demand for that product will increase.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-We determine whether goods are complements or substitutes based on cross price elasticity-if the cross price elasticity is positive the goods are substitutes, and if the cross price elasticity are negative the goods are complements.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The cross elasticity of demand for substitute goods is always positive because the demand for one good increases when the price for the substitute good increases. Alternatively, the cross elasticity of demand for complementary goods is negative.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A positive cross-price elasticity of demand between two products exhibits that the products are substitutes. This scenario implies that the price of one product has a positive relationship with the quantity demanded of another product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-If the value is less than 1, demand is inelastic. In other words, quantity changes slower than price. If the number is equal to 1, elasticity of demand is unitary. In other words, quantity changes at the same rate as price.
