<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-False. It is not true to say that someone’s wants are essential for survival. Wants are in a category of a desire and not necessity, and they are unlimited, and resources to satisfy them are limited. Due to their characteristics, such as changing over time, they are inessential for survival.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Food, water, clothing, and shelter are all needs. If a human body does not have those things, the body cannot function and will die.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:

<strong>Concept note-5:
