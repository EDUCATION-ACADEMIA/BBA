</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Real GDP. One thing people want to know about an economy is whether its total output of goods and services is growing or shrinking. But because GDP is collected at current, or nominal, prices, one cannot compare two periods without making adjustments for inflation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
