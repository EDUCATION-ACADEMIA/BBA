<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Ratios are written with the” : “symbol. If two quantities cannot be expressed in terms of the same unit, there cannot be a ratio between them. Hence to compare two quantities, the units must be the same. Consider an example to find the ratio of 3 km to 300 m.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The method of comparing two quantities by dividing one quantity by the other is called ratio. It is the quantitative relation between two amounts showing the number of times one value contains the other or is contained within the other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The ratio of the two quantities of the same kind and in the same units is a fraction that shows how many times one quantity is of the other. Ratio is denoted by using the symbol ‘:’. The ratio of two quantities a and b (b ≠ 0) is a/b and is denoted by a : b.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer: If the two quantities you are comparing have different units of measure, this kind of ratio is called a rate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A rate, like a ratio, is a comparison between two numbers or measurements, but the two numbers in a rate have different units. Eg: 2 miles per hour.
