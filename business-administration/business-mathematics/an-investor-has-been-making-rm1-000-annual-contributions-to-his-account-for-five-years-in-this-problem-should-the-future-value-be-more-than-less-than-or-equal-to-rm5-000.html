<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-How Is the Formula for Future Annuity Due Derived? In the first alternative, FV = PV (1 + r) n, i.e., you can multiply (1 + r) n by the current value of annuity due. The formula for current value of annuity due is (1 + r) * P 1-(1 + r)-n / r.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is F = P * ([1 + I]
