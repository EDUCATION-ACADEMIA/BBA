</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Sales commission rates range from 5% to as much as 50%, but most companies pay between 20-30%. To find the right fit that aligns with your sales goals, start by estimating how much it would cost to hire people under different sales commission structures-both for full-time staff and independent contractors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A commission, in its simplest form, is some percentage of revenue. For example, a salesperson may earn 3% of whatever they sell. If a product is sold for $100, the salesperson would earn $3 from that sale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-You should pay employees sales commissions in their normal paycheck after the sale is made. Another model pays the employees monthly.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
