<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Two quantities are said to be inversely proportional when the value of one quantity increases with respect to a decrease in another or vice-versa. This means that these two quantities behave opposite in nature. For example, the relation between speed and time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Inverse proportion is a type of proportionality relationship. If two quantities are inversely proportional then as one quantity increases, the other decreases. An example of inverse proportion would be the hours of work required to build a wall.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When two quantities X and Y increase together or decrease together, they are said to be Directly Proportional or they are in Direct Proportion with each other. It is also known as a Direct variation. The ratio of these values will remain constant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Two quantities are said to be proportional if their ratio is constant. In other words, the two quantities are proportional if one of them is always the product of the other and a constant quantity called coefficient of proportionality or proportionality constant.
