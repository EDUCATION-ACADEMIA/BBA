<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A positive correlation exists when one variable decreases as the other variable decreases, or one variable increases while the other increases. Because these two different variables move in the same direction, they theoretically are influenced by the same external forces.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Complete correlation between two variables is expressed by either + 1 or-1. When one variable increases as the other increases the correlation is positive; when one decreases as the other increases it is negative. Complete absence of correlation is represented by 0.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A correlation is a measure or degree of relationship between two variables. A set of data can be positively correlated, negatively correlated or not correlated at all. As one set of values increases the other set tends to increase then it is called a positive correlation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Negative correlation is a relationship between two variables in which one variable increases as the other decreases, and vice versa. In statistics, a perfect negative correlation is represented by the value-1.0, while a 0 indicates no correlation, and +1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Correlation is a statistical measure (expressed as a number) that describes the size and direction of a relationship between two or more variables. A correlation between variables, however, does not automatically mean that the change in one variable is the cause of the change in the values of the other variable.
