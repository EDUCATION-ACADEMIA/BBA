<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Dependent variable (aka criterion variable) is the main factor you are trying to understand and predict. Independent variables (aka explanatory variables, or predictors) are the factors that might influence the dependent variable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Criterion variable is a name used to describe the dependent variable in a variety of statistical modeling contexts, including multiple regression, discriminant analysis, and canonical correlation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-❖ The variable that researchers are trying to explain or predict is called the response variable. It is also sometimes called the dependent variable because it depends on another variable. ❖ The variable that is used to explain or predict the response variable is called the explanatory variable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It is something that depends on other factors. For example, a test score could be a dependent variable because it could change depending on several factors such as how much you studied, how much sleep you got the night before you took the test, or even how hungry you were when you took it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In a regression onevariable is considered to be the predictor (independent) variable, and theother is the criterion (dependent) variable. Thus, when we have theresults of the regression analysis, we can say that one variable causes, or isresponsible for a certain percentage of variation in the other variable.
