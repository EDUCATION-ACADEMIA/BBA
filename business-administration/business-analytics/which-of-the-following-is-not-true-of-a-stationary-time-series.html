<p>(A) The process generating the data has a constant mean. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The time series plot is a straight line.

<p>(C) The statistical properties are independent of time. 
</p>
<p>(D) The variability is constant over time.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The mean of the residuals is always zero.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-variance is NOT a time series component, it refers to the spread of a data set.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A common assumption in many time series techniques is that the data are stationary. A stationary process has the property that the mean, variance and autocorrelation structure do not change over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed. Thus, time series with trends, or with seasonality, are not stationary-the trend and seasonality will affect the value of the time series at different times.
