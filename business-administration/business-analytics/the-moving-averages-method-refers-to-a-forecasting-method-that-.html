<strong> The moving averages method refers to a forecasting method that ____ 
</strong>
<p>(A) is used when considerable trend, cyclical, or seasonal effects are present 
</p>
<p>(B) uses regression relationship based on past time series values to predict the future time series values 
</p>
<p>(C) relates a time series to other variables that are believed to explain or cause its behavior 
</p>
<p>(D) ** uses the average of the most recent data values in the time series as the forecast for the next period 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The moving average method uses the average of the most recent n data values in the time series as the forecast for the next period. Note that the n past observations are equally weighted. Issues with moving average forecast: All n past observations treated equally.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A forecasting technique referred to as moving averages uses the average or mean of the most recent n periods to forecast the next value for time series data. With a three-period moving average, the most recent three periods of data are used in the forecast computation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A moving average is a technique that calculates the overall trend in a data set. In operations management, the data set is sales volume from historical data of the company. This technique is very useful for forecasting short-term trends. It is simply the average of a select set of time periods.
