<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Definition: Random sampling is a part of the sampling technique in which each sample has an equal probability of being chosen. A sample chosen randomly is meant to be an unbiased representation of the total population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Sampling is the statistical process of selecting a subset (called a “sample”) of a population of interest for purposes of making observations and statistical inferences about that population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Simple random sampling is a type of probability sampling in which the researcher randomly selects a subset of participants from a population. Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Data is then collected from as large a percentage as possible of this random subset.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A random sample is meant to be an unbiased representation of the larger population. It is considered a fair way to select a sample from a larger population (since every member of the population has an equal chance of getting selected).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Random sampling is a method of choosing a sample of observations from a population to make assumptions about the population. It is also called probability sampling. The counterpart of this sampling is Non-probability sampling or Non-random sampling.
