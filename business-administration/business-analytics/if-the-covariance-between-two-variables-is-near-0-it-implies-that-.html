<strong> If the covariance between two variables is near 0, it implies that ____

<p>(A) a positive relationship exists between the variables 
</p>
<p>(B) ** the variables are not linearly related

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A correlation near 0 indicates no linear association between the variables.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A zero covariance means that the two variables are not related.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If the covariance is zero, then the cases in which the product was positive were offset by those in which it was negative, and there is no linear relationship between the two random variables.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Covariance indicates the relationship of two variables whenever one variable changes. If an increase in one variable results in an increase in the other variable, both variables are said to have a positive covariance. Decreases in one variable also cause a decrease in the other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-If the value of the simple correlation coefficient is zero, it means that there no relation whatsoever between the variables.

</strong>
</p>
<p>What happens when covariance is 0? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 3 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What does covariance tell us about the relationship between two variables? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 4 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Is the correlation between two variables zero it implies that? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 5 :
</strong>
</p>

</strong>
</p>
<p>How are covariance and correlation related?

</strong>
</p>
<p>When the covariance between the two variables is positive it means that?
