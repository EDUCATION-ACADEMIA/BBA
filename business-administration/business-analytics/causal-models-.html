<strong> Causal models ____ 
</strong>
<p>(A) provide evidence of a causal relationship between an independent variable and the variable to be forecast 
</p>
<p>(B) use the average of the most recent data values in the time series as the forecast for the next period 
</p>
<p>(C) occur whenever all the independent variables are previous values of the same time series 
</p>
<p>(D) ** relate a time series to other variables that are believed to explain or cause its behavior

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The time series causal model is grounded on the theory of inferred causation that is a probabilistic and graph-theoretic approach to causality featured with automated learning algo-rithms. Applying our model we are able to infer cause-effect relations that are implied by the observed time series data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Causation indicates that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; i.e. there is a causal relationship between the two events. This is also referred to as cause and effect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When two variables have a causal relationship, a change in the independent variable (or the ‘cause’) influences a change in the dependent variable (or the ‘effect’). There are four main criteria for causality: Covariation: The variables must vary together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Causal modeling requires the researcher to construct a model to explain the relationships among concepts related to a specific phenomenon (Asher, 1983). A causal model is a diagram of the relationships between independent, control, and dependent variables. A path model is a less complex type of causal model.
