<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The College Board originally scaled SAT scores so that the scores for each section were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. Assuming SAT scores follow a bell-shaped distribution; use the empirical rule to find the percent of students who scored more than 600.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-For data with a roughly bell-shaped (mound-shaped) distribution, About 68% of the data is within 1 standard deviation of the mean. About 95% of the data is within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The probability that a randomly selected individual from this population will have an SAT score at or below 600 is 100% – 16% = 84%, which is the left-tailed p value, .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The empirical rule (also called the “68-95-99.7 rule") is a guideline for how data is distributed in a normal distribution. The rule states that (approximately):-68% of the data points will fall within one standard deviation of the mean.-95% of the data points will fall within two standard deviations of the mean.
