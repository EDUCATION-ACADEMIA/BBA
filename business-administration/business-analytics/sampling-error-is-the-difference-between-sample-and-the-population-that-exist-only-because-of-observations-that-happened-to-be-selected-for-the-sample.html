<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A sampling error occurs when the sample used in the study is not representative of the whole population. Sampling is an analysis performed by selecting a number of observations from a larger population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Sampling error refers to the difference between the sample and the population that exists only because of the observations that happened to be selected for the sample.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The total error of the survey estimate results from the two types of error: sampling error, which arises when only a part of the population is used to represent the whole population; and. non-sampling error which can occur at any stage of a sample survey and can also occur with censuses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Sampling error This is because random samples are not identical to the population in terms of numerical measures like means and standard deviations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Expert-Verified Answer option a will be the right answer. it decreases as sample size increases.
