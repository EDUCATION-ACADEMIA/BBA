<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Simple random sampling. In simple random sampling (SRS), each sampling unit of a population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. Consequently, each possible sample also has an equal chance of being selected.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A random sample only requires that every item in a population has a greater than zero chance of being drawn. Unlike in a simple random sample, that probability may or may not be equal for every item. In simple random sampling, every element of a 1, 000-item set has an equal probability of one in 1, 000 to be selected.

</strong>-The Bottom Line When analyzing a population, simple random sampling is a technique that results in every item within the population to have the same probability of being selected for the sample size.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-For example, if you randomly select 1000 people from a town with a population of 100, 000 residents, each person has a 1000/100000 = 0.01 probability. That’s a simple calculation requiring no additional knowledge about the population’s composition. Hence, simple random sampling.
