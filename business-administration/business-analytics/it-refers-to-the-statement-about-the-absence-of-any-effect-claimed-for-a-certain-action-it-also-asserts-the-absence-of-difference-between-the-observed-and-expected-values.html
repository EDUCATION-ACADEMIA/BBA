</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The null hypothesis is a statistical hypothesis that states: Select one: There is no difference between a parameter and a specific value, or no difference between two parameters. There is no way to determine how likely an event is to occur.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The null hypothesis states that the treatment has no effect. In general the null hypothesis states that there is no change, no difference, no effect, and otherwise no relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Because we are hypothesizing that nothing is happening, it is called the null hypothesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A scientific hypothesis is a statement of what theresearcher expects to find upon conducting a study. A statistical hypothesis, however, is a statement of what the statisticianexpects NOT to find. For this reason it is called a NULL hypothesis.
