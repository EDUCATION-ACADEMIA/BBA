<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used for the estimation of relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It can be utilized to assess the strength of the relationship between variables and for modeling the future relationship between them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Simple regression analysis is a statistical procedure used to summarize a trend or relationship between two variables. The result is a line or curve on a graph, representing a model (a mathematical function), which describes the general relationship in the data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Regression analysis is a statistical procedure for developing a mathematical equation that describes how one dependent and one or more independent variables are related.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent (explanatory) variables. A regression model is able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the explanatory variables.
</p>
