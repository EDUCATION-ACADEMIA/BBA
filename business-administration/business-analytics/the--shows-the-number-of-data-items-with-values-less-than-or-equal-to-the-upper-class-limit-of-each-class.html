<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-However, rather than showing the frequency of each class, the cumulative frequency distribution shows the number of data items with values less than or equal to the upper class limit of each class. The last entry in a cumulative frequency distribution always equals the total number of observations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The cumulative relative frequency distribution shows the proportion of items with values less than or equal to the upper limit of each class.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The lowest number in a class interval is called the lower limit and the highest number is called the upper limit. This example is a case of continuous class intervals as the upper limit of one class is the lower limit of the following class.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Less Than Cumulative Frequency: The Less than cumulative frequency distribution is obtained by adding successively the frequencies of all the previous classes along with the class against which it is written. In this type, the cumulate begins from the lowest to the highest size.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Ogive Graph We can relate the shape and pattern of the two frequency distributions. The two methods of Ogives are: Less than Ogive. Greater than or more than Ogive.
