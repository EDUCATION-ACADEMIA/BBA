<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Joint probability is a statistical measure that calculates the likelihood of two events occurring together and at the same point in time. Joint probability is the probability of event Y occurring at the same time that event X occurs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Joint probability is the likelihood of more than one event occurring at the same time P(A and B). The probability of event A and event B occurring together. It is the probability of the intersection of two or more events written as p(A ∩ B).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Thus, the joint probability is also called the intersection of two or more events.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When A and B are independent events, the probability of A intersection B, P(A⋂B) = P(A)×P(B).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Formula for Joint Probability The symbol “∩” in a joint probability is called an intersection. The probability of event A and event B happening is the same thing as the point where A and B intersect. Hence, the joint probability is also called the intersection of two or more events.
