The BCG Growth-Share Matrix helps companies decide what to maintain, sell, or invest in. The BCG Growth-Share Matrix classifies products into four categories: dogs, cash cows, stars, and question marks.The four quadrants are designated Stars (upper left), Question Marks (upper right), Cash Cows (lower left) and Dogs (lower right). Place each of your products in the appropriate box based on where they rank in market share and growth.Fanta, a Coca-Cola product, is one such example where the business units can be seen as a question mark. As the brand has not been able to gain widespread popularity similar to Coke. Therefore, the brand is losing its popularity. However, in some areas, it has been able to obtain a generous sales volume.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The BCG Matrix: Question Marks Products in the question marks quadrant are in a market that is growing quickly but where the product(s) have a low market share. Question marks are the most managerially intensive products and require extensive investment and resources to increase their market share.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Explanation: The question mark symbolizes maintaining diversity in the BCG matrix. The BCG Growth-Share Matrix helps companies decide what to maintain, sell, or invest in. The BCG Growth-Share Matrix classifies products into four categories: dogs, cash cows, stars, and “question marks.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The four quadrants are designated Stars (upper left), Question Marks (upper right), Cash Cows (lower left) and Dogs (lower right). Place each of your products in the appropriate box based on where they rank in market share and growth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fanta, a Coca-Cola product, is one such example where the business units can be seen as a question mark. As the brand has not been able to gain widespread popularity similar to Coke. Therefore, the brand is losing its popularity. However, in some areas, it has been able to obtain a generous sales volume.
