<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The formula for absorption costing can be written as follows: Absorption cost = (Direct labor costs + Direct material costs + Variable manufacturing overhead costs + Fixed manufacturing overhead) / Number of units produced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-So Formula for the total cost in absorption costing is given by: Total Cost = Total Direct Cost + Total Overhead Cost. Total Direct Cost = Direct Material Cost + Direct Labor. Total Overhead Cost = Variable Overheads + Fixed Overheads.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Product costs under absorption costing include both manufacturing costs. Product costs under variable costing include only variable manufacturing costs. Absorption costing accounts for fixed manufacturing overhead as a product cost. Variable costing accounts for fixed manufacturing overhead as a period cost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Calculate the ABSORPTION. Subtract the total occupied space (Ob ) at the beginning of the period from the total occupied space (Oe ) at the end of the period. The result is the Net Absorption (A).
