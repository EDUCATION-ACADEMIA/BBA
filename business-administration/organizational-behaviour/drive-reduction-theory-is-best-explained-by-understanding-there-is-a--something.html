</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Drive theory is based on the principle that organisms are born with certain psychological needs and that a negative state of tension is created when these needs are not satisfied. When a need is satisfied, drive is reduced and the organism returns to a state of homeostasis and relaxation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When the body is out of balance, a need develops and the tension provides the drive to reduce the need and return the body to a state of balance. Drive-reduction theory, however, cannot explain why people would increase their internal tension by doing things like parachuting out of an airplane.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
