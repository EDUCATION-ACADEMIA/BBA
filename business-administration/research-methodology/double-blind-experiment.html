<strong> Double-Blind Experiment 
</strong>
<p>(A) an experiment in which the participants are unaware of which participants received the treatment 
</p>
<p>(B) a number that describes something about the “average” score of a distribution 
</p>
<p>(C) ** an experiment in which neither the experimenter nor the participants know which participants received which treatment 
</p>
<p>(D) numerical methods used to determine whether research data support a hypothesis or whether results were due to chance

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A type of clinical trial in which neither the participants nor the researcher knows which treatment or intervention participants are receiving until the clinical trial is over. This makes results of the study less likely to be biased.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The correct answer is a blind experiment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A double-blind study withholds each subject’s group assignment from both the participant and the researcher performing the experiment. If participants know which group they are assigned to, there is a risk that they might change their behavior in a way that would influence the results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Therefore, both research participants and researchers are blind to this information. Double-blind studies help in reducing the biases like the placebo effect, experimenter bias, and experimenter expectancy effect that hinder the results and conclusions of the study.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Medication Experiments A double-blind experiment is beneficial when testing a specific medication. Half of the participants are given the medication, and the remaining participants are given a placebo. A placebo is an inactive substance such as a sugar pill that looks identical to the medication.
