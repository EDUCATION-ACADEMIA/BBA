<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Independent variables (IV): These are the factors or conditions that you manipulate in an experiment. Your hypothesis is that this variable causes a direct effect on the dependent variable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An experiment is a type of empirical study that features the manipulation of an independent variable, the measurement of a dependent variable, and control of extraneous variables.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-With an experimental research design, the researcher lays out how he or she will manipulate one of more independent variables and measure their effect on the dependent variable. Some research designs involve no manipulation of independent variables.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Manipulation means that something is purposefully changed by the researcher in the environment. Control is used to prevent outside factors from influencing the study outcome. When something is manipulated and controlled and then the outcome happens, it makes us more confident that the manipulation “caused” the outcome.
