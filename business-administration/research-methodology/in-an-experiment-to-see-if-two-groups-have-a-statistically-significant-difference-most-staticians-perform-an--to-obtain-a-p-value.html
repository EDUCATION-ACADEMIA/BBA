<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If the means of the two groups are large relative to what we would expect to occur from sample to sample, we consider the difference to be significant. If the difference between the group means is small relative to the amount of sampling variability, the difference will not be significant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The independent t-test is also called the two-sample t-test. It is a statistical test that determines whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means in two unrelated groups. For example, comparing cancer patients and pregnant women in a population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Comparison tests look for differences among group means. They can be used to test the effect of a categorical variable on the mean value of some other characteristic. T-tests are used when comparing the means of precisely two groups (e.g., the average heights of men and women).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used when you have a categorical independent variable (with two or more categories) and a normally distributed interval dependent variable and you wish to test for differences in the means of the dependent variable broken down by the levels of the independent variable.
