<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Probability sampling means that every member of the target population has a known chance of being included in the sample. Probability sampling methods include simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In simple random sampling (SRS), each sampling unit of a population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. Consequently, each possible sample also has an equal chance of being selected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cluster random sample: The population is first split into groups. The overall sample consists of every member from some of the groups. The groups are selected at random.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Nonprobability sampling is a sampling technique in which some units of the population have zero chance of selection or where the probability of selection cannot be accurately determined. Typically, units are selected based on certain non-random criteria, such as quota or convenience.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In a non-probability sample, some members of the population, compared to other members, have a greater but unknown chance of selection. There are five main types of non-probability sample: convenience, purposive, quota, snowball, and self-selection.
