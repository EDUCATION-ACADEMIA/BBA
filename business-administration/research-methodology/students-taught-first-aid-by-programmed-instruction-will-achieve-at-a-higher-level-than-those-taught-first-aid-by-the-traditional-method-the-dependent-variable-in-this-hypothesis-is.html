<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-helps to explain a relationship between two other variables. “Students taught first aid by programmed instruction will achieve at a higher level than those taught first aid by the traditional method.” The dependent variable in this hypothesis is: a. the level of achievement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In an experiment, the independent variable is manipulated and the effects observed. These observed effects are called dependent variables. They are often the hypothesized outcome of manipulating the independent variable. A change in the dependent variable depends on the independent variable, hence the name.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In any scientific investigation like experiment and scientific research, for the formulation of the hypothesis (tentative answer to the problem) the problem is necessary in first place that has a clear and broad scope of observation and knowledge.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The dependent variable is the variable that is being measured or tested in an experiment. 1 For example, in a study looking at how tutoring impacts test scores, the dependent variable would be the participants’ test scores since that is what is being measured.
