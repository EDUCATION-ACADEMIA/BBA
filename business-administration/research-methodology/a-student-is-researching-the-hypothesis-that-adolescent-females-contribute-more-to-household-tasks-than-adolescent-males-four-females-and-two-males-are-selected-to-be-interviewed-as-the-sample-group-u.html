<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Gender roles (what it means to be a boy, a girl, or somewhere else on the gender spectrum) shape all of our relationships, especially in our families. Gender roles influence how partners share household chores, how family members communicate with one another, and how parents interact with their children.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Children’s beliefs and self-stereotyping: The study found that when mothers explicitly believed that women are more likely than men to handle domestic tasks, and when fathers explicitly identified as work-oriented, their sons and daughters were more likely to hold gender-stereotypical beliefs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Parents provide children with their first lessons about gender. Possible ways that parents might influence children’s gender development include role modeling and encouraging different behaviours and activities in sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Research has shown that parents with stronger gender stereotyped beliefs are more likely to parent in gendered ways. In one study with toddlers, fathers with more stereotypical gender attitudes used more physical control with sons than with daughters.
