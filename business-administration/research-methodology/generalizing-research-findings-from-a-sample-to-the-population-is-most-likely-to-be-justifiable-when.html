<strong> Generalizing research findings from a sample to the population is most likely to be justifiable when: 
</strong>
<p>(A) a small systematic sample is used 
</p>
<p>(B) cluster sampling is used in a large, heterogeneous population 
</p>
<p>(C) the null hypothesis is confirmed, regardless of the sampling procedures used

<p>(D) ** a large random sample is used

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Because selection is non-random, nonprobability sampling does not allow the estimation of sampling errors, and may be subjected to a sampling bias. Therefore, information from a sample cannot be generalized back to the population. Types of non-probability sampling techniques include: Convenience sampling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Random sampling consists of selecting a sufficient number of subjects at random from a population to ensure that results are indicative of the population at large. If your research goal is to generalize your results from your sample to an entire population, then you must utilize a random sampling strategy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Generalization is the extension of sample-based research results to the whole population; also it implies that such studyâ€™s findings may be applied to another similar predicament. It is important because as in above mentioned example the researcher uses individuals as a sample from the whole population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The researcher could select an equal number of participants from each stratum, or they could select participants proportionally based on the estimated size of each stratum. Proportional sampling is preferred if the sample is to be generalizable.
