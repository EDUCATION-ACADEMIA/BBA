<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Validity refers to how accurately a method measures what it is intended to measure. If research has high validity, that means it produces results that correspond to real properties, characteristics, and variations in the physical or social world. High reliability is one indicator that a measurement is valid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What is criterion validity? To evaluate criterion validity, you calculate the correlation between the results of your measurement and the results of the criterion measurement. If there is a high correlation, this gives a good indication that your test is measuring what it intends to measure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Measurement validity is the extent to which the data or results of a research method represent the intended variable. Valid results display accuracy in research methods and results. It’s important for methods and results to have validity so the research results can be useful and applied in various settings.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Criterion-related validity In other words – if your measure has a high correlation with other measures that are known to be valid because of previous research.
