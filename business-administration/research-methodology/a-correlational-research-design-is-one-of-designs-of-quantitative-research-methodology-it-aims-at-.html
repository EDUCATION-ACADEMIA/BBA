<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-What is correlational research? A correlational research design investigates relationships between two variables (or more) without the researcher controlling or manipulating any of them. It’s a non-experimental type of quantitative research.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The aim of correlational research is to identify variables that have some sort of relationship do the extent that a change in one creates some change in the other. This type of research is descriptive, unlike experimental research that relies entirely on scientific methodology and hypothesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The correlation coefficient should not be used to say anything about cause and effect relationship. By examining the value of ‘r’, we may conclude that two variables are related, but that ‘r’ value does not tell us if one variable was the cause of the change in the other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The distinctive feature of correlational research is that the researcher can’t manipulate either of the variable involved. It doesn’t matter how or where the variables are measured. A researcher could observe participants in a closed environment or a public setting.
