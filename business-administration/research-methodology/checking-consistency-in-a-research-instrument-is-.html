<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Reliability refers to how consistently a method measures something. If the same result can be consistently achieved by using the same methods under the same circumstances, the measurement is considered reliable. You measure the temperature of a liquid sample several times under identical conditions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure (whether the results can be reproduced under the same conditions). Validity refers to the accuracy of a measure (whether the results really do represent what they are supposed to measure).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Reliability refers to the extent that the instrument yields the same results over multiple trials. Validity refers to the extent that the instrument measures what it was designed to measure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Description. Internal consistency is a measure of reliability. Reliability refers to the extent to which a measure yields the same number or score each time it is administered, all other things being equal (Hays &amp; Revicki, 2005).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Reliability is consistency across time (test-retest reliability), across items (internal consistency), and across researchers (interrater reliability). Validity is the extent to which the scores actually represent the variable they are intended to. Validity is a judgment based on various types of evidence.
