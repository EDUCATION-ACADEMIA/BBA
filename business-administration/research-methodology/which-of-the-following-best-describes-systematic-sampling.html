<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling method in which sample members from a larger population are selected according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval. This interval, called the sampling interval, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Systematic sampling is a probability sampling method where researchers select members of the population at a regular interval – for example, by selecting every 15th person on a list of the population. If the population is in a random order, this can imitate the benefits of simple random sampling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In systematic sampling, all units of the population have equal chance of being elected in the sample.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Systematic sampling: Researchers use the systematic sampling method to choose the sample members of a population at regular intervals. It requires selecting a starting point for the sample and sample size that can be repeated at regular intervals.
