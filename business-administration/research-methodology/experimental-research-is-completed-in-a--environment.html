<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The experimental research design must be carried out in a controlled environment. Throughout the experiment, the researcher collects data that can support or refute a hypothesis, thus, this research is also referred to as hypothesis testing or a deductive research method.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In experiments, researchers manipulate independent variables to test their effects on dependent variables. In a controlled experiment, all variables other than the independent variable are controlled or held constant so they donâ€™t influence the dependent variable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Laboratory research is carried out in a controlled environment in order to isolate a dependent variable and establish its relationship with other variables through scientific methods.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Experimental controls are techniques that researchers utilize to minimize the effects of extraneous experience and environmental variables as well as to strengthen the inference that changes in the dependent variable are due to the independent variable (the ability to infer causality).

<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Experimental research allows you to test your idea in a controlled environment before taking the research to clinical trials. Moreover, it provides the best method to test your theory because of the following advantages: Researchers have firm control over variables to obtain results.
