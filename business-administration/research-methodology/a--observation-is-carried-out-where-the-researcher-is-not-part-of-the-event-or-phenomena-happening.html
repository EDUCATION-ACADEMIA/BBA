<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Sociologists often use observations as a research method. A non-participant observation is one where the researcher chooses not to play any part in what is being observed. An advantage of this is that it allows for a more objective view of what is occurring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Researchers collect data by observing behavior without actively interacting with the participants. 01 You can also do overt non-participant observation, for example, when researchers sit in on meetings or workshops on site, but do not actively participate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A way to gather data by watching people, events, or noting physical characteristics in their natural setting. Observations can be overt (subjects know they are being observed) or covert (do not know they are being watched). Researcher becomes a participant in the culture or context being observed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Participant observation is when the observer becomes a part of the group that is being studied. This type of observation allows the observer to get a closer look at the group and their behaviour. Non-participant observation is when the observer remains outside the group and simply watches their behaviour.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Another approach to data collection in observational research is participant observation. In participant observation, researchers become active participants in the group or situation they are studying.
