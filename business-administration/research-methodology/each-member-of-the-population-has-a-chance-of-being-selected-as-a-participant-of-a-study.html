<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-For a participant to be considered as a probability sample, he/she must be selected using a random selection. This statistical method used to select a sample from a population in such a way that each member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Simple random sampling. In simple random sampling (SRS), each sampling unit of a population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. Consequently, each possible sample also has an equal chance of being selected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Simple random sampling In this case each individual is chosen entirely by chance and each member of the population has an equal chance, or probability, of being selected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Probability sampling is based on the fact that every member of a population has a known and equal chance of being selected. For example, if you had a population of 100 people, each person would have odds of 1 out of 100 of being chosen. With non-probability sampling, those odds are not equal.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In probability sampling, each member of the population has a known probability of being selected.
