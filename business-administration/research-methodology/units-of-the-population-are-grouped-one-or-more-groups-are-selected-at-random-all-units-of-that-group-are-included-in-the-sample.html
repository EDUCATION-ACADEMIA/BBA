<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Stratified random sample: The population is first split into groups. The overall sample consists of some members from every group. The members from each group are chosen randomly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cluster sampling divides the population into groups, then takes a random sample from each cluster. Both systematic and cluster sampling are forms of random sampling, known as probability sampling, which stands in contrast to non-probability sampling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Probability sampling refers to the selection of a sample from a population, when this selection is based on the principle of randomization, that is, random selection or chance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Cluster sampling is defined as a sampling method where the researcher creates multiple clusters of people from a population where they are indicative of homogeneous characteristics and have an equal chance of being a part of the sample.
