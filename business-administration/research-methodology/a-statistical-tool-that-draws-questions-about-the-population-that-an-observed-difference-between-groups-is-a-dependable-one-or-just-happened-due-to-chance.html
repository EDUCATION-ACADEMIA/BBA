<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Inferential statistics are tools that statisticians use to draw conclusions about the characteristics of a population, drawn from the characteristics of a sample, and to decide how certain they can be of the reliability of those conclusions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A t-test is an inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related. T-tests are used when the data sets follow a normal distribution and have unknown variances, like the data set recorded from flipping a coin 100 times.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Statistical tests are used as a way to quantify if there is an association, a difference or relationship between variables. These tests are performed on sample data, with the aim of inferring beyond the sample data to the wider population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The goal of inferential statistics is to discover some property or general pattern about a large group by studying a smaller group of people in the hopes that the results will generalize to the larger group.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Difference Between Descriptive and Inferential statistics As you can see, Descriptive statistics summarize the features or characteristics of a data set, while Inferential statistics enables the user to test a hypothesis to check if the data is generalizable to the wider population.
