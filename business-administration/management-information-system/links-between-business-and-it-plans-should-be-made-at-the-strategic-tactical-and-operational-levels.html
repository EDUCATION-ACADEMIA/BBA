<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Strategic plans are based on longest-term planning horizon, operational plans shortest planning horizon (even on a day-to-day basis), and tactical plans, in between. In terms of relationships, operational plans lead to the achievement of tactical plans, which in turn lead to the attainment of strategic plans.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Operational plans support the strategic plan by laying out an action plan for a particular goal or project. They can also map out how individual business units or departments will contribute to organizational goals. Typically, operational plans have a short-term time horizon, typically a fiscal year.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In management, there are varying levels of control: strategic (highest level), operational (mid-level), and tactical (low level). Imagine the president of a company decides to build a new company headquarters. He enlists the help of the companyâ€™s officers to decide on the location, style of architecture, size, etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A tactical plan may include detailed schedules or instructions on how to complete tasks. Operational Plans describe what will happen during a given period of time. These plans are often referred to as operational plans because they define the day-to-day operations of an organization.
