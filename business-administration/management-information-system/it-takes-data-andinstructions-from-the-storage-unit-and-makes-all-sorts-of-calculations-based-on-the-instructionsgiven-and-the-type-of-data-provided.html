<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Processing: The task of performing operations like arithmetic and logical operations is called processing. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) takes data and instructions from the storage unit and makes all sorts of calculations based on the instructions given and the type of data provided.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Central Processing Unit (CPU) The CPU is the brain of a computer, containing all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Storage Unit is responsible for storing the data after immediate results of processing whereas; the ALU is responsible for various arithmetic and bitwise operations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Random access memory (RAM) is a type of data storage used in computers that is generally located on the motherboard. It is the main memory used by a computer for quick access since is much faster to read and write than other forms of storage-between 20-100 times faster than hard disks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Cache memory is the fastest system memory, required to keep up with the CPU as it fetches and executes instructions. The data most frequently used by the CPU is stored in cache memory.
