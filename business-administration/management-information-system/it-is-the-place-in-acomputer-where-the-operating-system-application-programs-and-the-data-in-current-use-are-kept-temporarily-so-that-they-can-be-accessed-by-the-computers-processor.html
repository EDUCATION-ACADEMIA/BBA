<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device’s processor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-RAM is one of the main parts of a computer and it stores the application programs, operating system, and the data that is currently used. It takes a shorter time to read data from RAM and to write data in it. Therefore, the processor of a computer can access the data stored in the Random Access Memory, in a short time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cache memory. This temporary storage area, known as a cache, is more readily available to the processor than the computer’s main memory source. It is also called CPU memory because it is typically integrated directly into the CPU chip or placed on a separate chip with a bus interconnect with the CPU.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Primary storage, also known as main storage or memory, is the area in a computer in which data is stored for quick access by the computer’s processor. The terms random access memory (RAM) and memory are often as synonyms for primary or main storage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Memory is the part of the computer that holds data and instructions for processing. Although closely associated with the central processing unit, memory is separate from it. Memory stores program instructions or data for only as long as the program they pertain to is in operation.
