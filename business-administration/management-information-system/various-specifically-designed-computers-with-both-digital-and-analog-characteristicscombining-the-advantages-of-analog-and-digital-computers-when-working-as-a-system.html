<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Various specifically designed computers are with both digital and analog characteristics combining the advantages of analog and digital computers when working as a system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Hybrid computers are well known for their ability to blend analog and digital features of computers. Advantages include the availability of both analog and digital computations within a single unit and an efficient processing speed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A hybrid computer is a mix of digital and analog computers that incorporates the best aspects of both. i.e. Analog computers handle complex mathematical computations (problems), and Digital computers handle logical and numerical operations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The chief advantage of analog machines is that it can be easier to simulate a physical situation via hooking up (usually via plug board wires) various combinations of signal generators, integrating devices etc than learning how to write a program.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An analog computer is a computer which is used to process analog data. Analog computers store data in a continuous form of physical quantities and perform calculations with the help of measures. It is quite different from the digital computer, which makes use of symbolic numbers to represent results.
