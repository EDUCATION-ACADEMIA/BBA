Another aspect of unity of command is issuing orders to subordinates as if the orders were our own. This is an important aspect of unity of command.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The principle of ‘Unity of Command’ states that employees should receive orders and instructions from one boss only. If two (or more) superiors command a worker at the same time, he will get confused to whose command should he follow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The principle of the order states that a place should be fixed for everything and everyone and everything and everyone should be in its place. Essentially it means orderliness. If there is a fixed place for everything and it is present there, then there will be no hindrance in the activities of business/ factory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Unity of command states that a subordinate should receive order and be responsible to only one boss. This ensures that each employee gets command only from one superior and is accountable to the same. This does not create confusion on whom to report and where are the commands coming from.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Unity of Command According to Fayol, an employee should receive orders from only one manager. If an employee works under two or more managers, then authority, discipline, and stability are threatened.
