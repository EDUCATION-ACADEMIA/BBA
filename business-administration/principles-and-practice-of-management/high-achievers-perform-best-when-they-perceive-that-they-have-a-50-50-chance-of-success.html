<meta name="description" content="High achievers perform best when they perceive their probability of success as being 0.5, that is, when they estimate that they have a 50-50 chance of success. They dislike gambling with high odds because they get no achievement satisfaction from happenstance success.People motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.People who possess high achievement needs are people who always work to excel by particularly avoiding low reward low-risk situations and difficult to achieve high-risk situations. Such people avoid low-risk situations because of the lack of a real challenge and their understanding that such achievement is not genuine.People with a high need for achievement seek to excel and thus tend to avoid both low-risk and high-risk situations. Achievers avoid low-risk situations because the easily attained success is not a genuine achievement. In high-risk projects, achievers see the outcome as one of chance rather than ones own effort.Achievement Theory of Motivation is all about how needs of an individual change over a period of time with changes in his experience. The theory also explains what effects an individuals need for achievement, power, and affiliation have on their behavior.">

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-High achievers perform best when they perceive their probability of success as being 0.5, that is, when they estimate that they have a 50-50 chance of success. They dislike gambling with high odds because they get no achievement satisfaction from happenstance success.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-People motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-People who possess high achievement needs are people who always work to excel by particularly avoiding low reward low-risk situations and difficult to achieve high-risk situations. Such people avoid low-risk situations because of the lack of a real challenge and their understanding that such achievement is not genuine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-People with a high need for achievement seek to excel and thus tend to avoid both low-risk and high-risk situations. Achievers avoid low-risk situations because the easily attained success is not a genuine achievement. In high-risk projects, achievers see the outcome as one of chance rather than one’s own effort.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Achievement Theory of Motivation is all about how needs of an individual change over a period of time with changes in his experience. The theory also explains what effects an individual’s need for achievement, power, and affiliation have on their behavior.
