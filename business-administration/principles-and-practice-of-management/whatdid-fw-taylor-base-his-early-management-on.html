<meta name="description" content="Taylor believed that all workers were motivated by money, so he promoted the idea of a fair days pay for a fair days work. In other words, if a worker didnt achieve enough in a day, he didnt deserve to be paid as much as another worker who was highly productive.Taylors theory of motivation is also known as the money as a motivator theory. It argues that money is the main force that motivates employees to work at a company. According to Taylor, there is only one right way to do each job-that is to motivate employees with coercion (threat of firing) or money.Frederick Winslow Taylor is known as the Father of Scientific Management, which also came to be known as Taylorism. Taylor believed that it was the role and responsibility of manufacturing plant managers to determine the best way for the worker to do a job, and to provide the proper tools and training.Taylors scientific management is based on the following four principles: Science not Rule of Thumb: Taylor focused on the scientific study and analysis of each and every element of a work to replace the old rule of thumb method or hit and trial method. Rule of thumb is not based on science or exact measurement.Taylors was based on the view that money motivates people. Pay is based on the output per employees (called piece-rate). Employees would do as they were told because if they followed instructions they would be more productive and earn more.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Taylor believed that all workers were motivated by money, so he promoted the idea of “a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work.” In other words, if a worker didn’t achieve enough in a day, he didn’t deserve to be paid as much as another worker who was highly productive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Taylor’s theory of motivation is also known as the money as a motivator theory. It argues that money is the main force that motivates employees to work at a company. According to Taylor, there is only one right way to do each job-that is to motivate employees with coercion (threat of firing) or money.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Frederick Winslow Taylor is known as the Father of Scientific Management, which also came to be known as “Taylorism.” Taylor believed that it was the role and responsibility of manufacturing plant managers to determine the best way for the worker to do a job, and to provide the proper tools and training.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Taylor’s scientific management is based on the following four principles: Science not Rule of Thumb: Taylor focused on the scientific study and analysis of each and every element of a work to replace the old rule of thumb method or hit and trial method. Rule of thumb is not based on science or exact measurement.
