<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Employees should be aware of where they stand in the organization’s hierarchy or chain of command. In scalar chain, Fayol knows that for centralization to even be possible, there needs to be a chain of command, and each member must be aware of their place in the hierarchy of the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Scalar Chain. Employees should know where they stand in the organization’s hierarchy and who to speak to within a chain of command. Fayol suggested the now-familiar organization chart as a way for employees to see this structure clearly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Scalar chain is a chain of all supervisors from the top management to the person working in the lowest rank. Description: A clear line of communication is very important for any organisation to achieve its objectives. The communication has to flow in an order for it to be effective. Scale chain identifies that path.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The scalar principle refers to a linear flow of communication in an organization, where information is relayed through an unbroken chain from upper management down to all employees.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Scalar Chain refers to a pre-defined, formal path of authority and communication in the order of highest to the lowest. For example-if A is the CEO of an organisation and he has two paths of authorities under him, namely the finance department and the sales department.
