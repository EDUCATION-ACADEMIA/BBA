<title>Why does a company measure productivity?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Measuring the productivity of your company or department allows you to make operational changes, adding employees or equipment to meet deadlines. Understanding the productivity of your workforce also allows you to gauge overall efficiency and whether you can meet tight deadlines or take on new clients.Rather, productivity is output divided by input. So the job of productivity measurement is to highlight how to get more units of output (goods produced or services rendered) for each unit of input (materials, labor hours, machine time) than your competitors are able to deliver.Productivity is commonly defined as a ratio between the output volume and the volume of inputs. In other words, it measures how efficiently production inputs, such as labour and capital, are being used in an economy to produce a given level of output.At the corporate level, productivity is a measure of the efficiency of a companys production process, it is calculated by measuring the number of units produced relative to employee labor hours or by measuring a companys net sales relative to employee labor hours.Quality is important for customer satisfaction that ultimately results in customer loyalty. Quality management assists an organisation to create and developing a product/service which is desired by the customers. Quality establishes that higher revenues and productivity is achieved for the organisation.">
