<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Unity of command: This principle states that an employee should have one and only one supervisor to whom he or she is directly responsible. No employee should report to two or more people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Under the principles of war, unity of command means that all the forces fall under one responsible commander. It requires a single commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces in pursuit of a unified purpose. Simply put, it means one mission, one boss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Unity of command means that each individual involved in incident operations will be assigned – and will report – to only one supervisor. Chain of command and unity of command help to ensure clear reporting relationships exist and eliminate the confusion caused by multiple, conflicting directives.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The unity of command principle states that a person should report to one immediate superior only. If performing as a project manager, you need to develop an organizational structure that applies this principle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-For example, imagine you are the CEO of a technology firm in Silicon Valley. While the board of directors of your company governs the policy making and strategic planning, under the concept of unity of command, you do not answer to all members of the board, but only the chairman of the board.
