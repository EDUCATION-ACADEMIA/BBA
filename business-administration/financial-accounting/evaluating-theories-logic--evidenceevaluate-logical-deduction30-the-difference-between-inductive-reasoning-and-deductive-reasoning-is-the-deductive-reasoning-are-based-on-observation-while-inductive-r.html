In deductive reasoning, the conclusions are certain, whereas, in Inductive reasoning, the conclusions are probabilistic.Whats the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning? Inductive reasoning is a bottom-up approach, while deductive reasoning is top-down. Inductive reasoning takes you from the specific to the general, while in deductive reasoning, you make inferences by going from general premises to specific conclusions.A deductive approach (rule-driven) starts with the presentation of a rule and is followed by examples in which the rule is applied. An inductive approach (rule-discovery) starts with some examples from which a rule is inferred. Both approaches are commonplace in published materials.Deductive reasoning, or deduction, is making an inference based on widely accepted facts or premises. If a beverage is defined as drinkable through a straw, one could use deduction to determine soup to be a beverage. Inductive reasoning, or induction, is making an inference based on an observation, often of a sample.Deductive reasoning applies general rules to make conclusions about specific cases. Inductive reasoning observes patterns in specific cases to infer conclusions about general rules. For example: All men are mortal. John is a man.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Deductive reasoning moves from generalized statement to a valid conclusion, whereas Inductive reasoning moves from specific observation to a generalization. In deductive reasoning, the conclusions are certain, whereas, in Inductive reasoning, the conclusions are probabilistic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What’s the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning? Inductive reasoning is a bottom-up approach, while deductive reasoning is top-down. Inductive reasoning takes you from the specific to the general, while in deductive reasoning, you make inferences by going from general premises to specific conclusions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A deductive approach (rule-driven) starts with the presentation of a rule and is followed by examples in which the rule is applied. An inductive approach (rule-discovery) starts with some examples from which a rule is inferred. Both approaches are commonplace in published materials.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Deductive reasoning, or deduction, is making an inference based on widely accepted facts or premises. If a beverage is defined as “drinkable through a straw, ” one could use deduction to determine soup to be a beverage. Inductive reasoning, or induction, is making an inference based on an observation, often of a sample.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Deductive reasoning applies general rules to make conclusions about specific cases. Inductive reasoning observes patterns in specific cases to infer conclusions about general rules. For example: All men are mortal. John is a man.
