<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Deductive reasoning is a logical process in which a conclusion is based on the concordance of multiple premises that are generally assumed to be true. Deductive reasoning is sometimes referred to as top-down logic. Deductive reasoning relies on making logical premises and basing a conclusion around those premises.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Deductive logic (also called deductive reasoning or deduction) is a precise and well-ordered system that aims to provide definite support for a conclusion. While inductive reasoning can show that a conclusion is probably true, deductive reasoning can show that a conclusion must be true.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Deductive reasoning is a top-down approach, while inductive reasoning is a bottom-up approach. In deductive reasoning, you start with general ideas and work toward specific conclusions through inferences. Based on theories, you form a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This is inductive reasoning. In an inductive argument the conclusion is, at best, probable. The conclusion is not always true when the premises are true. The probability of the conclusion depends on the strength of the inference from the premises.
