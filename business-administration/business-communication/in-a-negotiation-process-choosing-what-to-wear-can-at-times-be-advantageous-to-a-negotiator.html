<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Negotiations may preserve and in some cases even enhance the relationship between the parties once an agreement has been reached between them. Opting for negotiation instead of litigation may be less expensive for the parties and may reduce delays.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It’s not just about being perfectly put together-you have to be quietly perfect: Whenever possible, wear a suit. For high-formality settings that means a dark business suit (navy blue or charcoal gray). Anywhere that would be too formal, wear a lighter suit, like a medium gray or a muted Glen plaid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Most research suggests that negotiators with a primarily cooperative style are more successful than hard bargainers at reaching novel solutions that improve everyone’s outcomes. Negotiators who lean toward cooperation also tend to be more satisfied with the process and their results, according to Weingart.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The most effective way to use time is to never begin negotiating with the other person until you know they have to make a decision, and it needs to be done in a short period of time. The more time the other person has to make a decision, the longer the negotiation process is going to take.
