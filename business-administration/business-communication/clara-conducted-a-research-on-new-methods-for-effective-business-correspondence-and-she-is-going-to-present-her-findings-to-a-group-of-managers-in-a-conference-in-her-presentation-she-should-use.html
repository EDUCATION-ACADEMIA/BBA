<strong> Clara conducted a research on ‘New Methods for Effective Business Correspondence’ and she is going to present her findings to a group of managers in a conference. In her presentation, she should use 
</strong>
<p>(A) many tables because tables can show comparison better than any other types of illustration 
</p>
<p>(B) ** graphs as a mean of showing the current trend that many companies are following in their organisation 
</p>
<p>(C) videos because by using them, she does not have to talk much as the videos can ‘present’ the findings for her 
</p>
<p>(D) flow charts because they help present the different processes involved in changing from the old method to the new ones
