Often, the additional sale is much smaller than the original purchase and is a complementary product.Suggestive selling is a sales approach where you either suggest shoppers add complimentary products to their initial purchase (cross selling) or compel them to purchase an item with a higher price point than what they were initially interested in buying (upselling).The most common method of suggestion selling is to use a product demonstration.
